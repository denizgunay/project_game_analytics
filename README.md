# Game Analytics Project

This project performs comprehensive analysis on game-related data with approximately 300 million records. The data manipulations and transformations are executed entirely using SQL queries. The project provides insights into key metrics, A/B testing, modeling, and prediction tasks relevant to game analytics.

## Project Overview

The Game Analytics project is organized into four main parts:

1. **Analysis**: This part includes general data analysis and exploration of the game data, providing insights into player behavior and performance.
2. **A/B Testing**: Statistical tests to compare different versions of the game or game features, determining the impact of specific changes on user engagement and retention.
3. **Modeling**: Involves building and evaluating models for user behavior prediction.
4. **Prediction**: In this part, you can test the model.
